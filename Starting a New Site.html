            <h3>Why need Website</h3>
            <p>A website is an essential tool for businesses in the modern world. Customers expect to be able to find
                information about your company online, and a well-designed website is the best way to provide them with
                the information they need. A website can also be a great platform for promoting your products or
                services and generating sales.</p>

            <h3>What do you need?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A domain name.</li>
                <li> web hosting.</li>
                <li>a website builder.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Choosing a domain name</h3>
            <p>Choose your domain name carefully, considering both the name itself and the extension. For example, should it be .com, .dk, or .info?

                In general, it is a good idea for the name to reflect the content of the site, such as the company name, area of interest, or brand name. However, keep in mind that some innocent words can form rather unfortunate domain names. For example:
                
                Who Represents: www.whorepresents.com - can be read as "Whore Presents"
                Pen Island: www.penisland.net - can be read as "Penis Land"
                Therapist Finder: www.therapistfinder.com - can be read as "The Rapist Finder"
                
                Extensions are important, too. For example, extensions like .dk or .de indicate to search engines that the site is Danish or German, respectively. If you have a .dk domain but the site is in English, the search engine may have difficulty indexing it. Or, if you have a site in Danish that is aimed at the Danish market, it is better to have a .dk domain than a .com domain.
                
                Language-neutral extensions like .com, .biz You can inadvertently form some rather unfortunate domain names from completely innocent words. Just take a look at these real life examples:

                Who Represents: www.whorepresents.com - can be read as "Whore Presents"
                Pen Island: www.penisland.net - can be read as "Penis Land"
                Therapist Finder: www.therapistfinder.com - can be read as "The Rapist Finder"
                
                When creating a website, be mindful of the domain name you choose. It is recommended that the domain name contain the words the site is about, for example FeliciasFlowerGarden.com. However, if the site is for a brand, like Nike, then using only the brand name is common. Another tip is to choose a language-neutral extension like .com, .biz, or .info. These are easier for search engines to handle than country-specific extensions.</p>

                <h3>Web Server</h3>
                <p>
                    A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.</p>
                <h3>Web Hotel</h3>
                <p>A web hotel is a type of internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. A web hotel provides space on a server that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.</p>

                <h3>HTML editor</h3>
                <p>
                    An HTML editor is a computer program for editing HTML, the markup of a webpage. Although the HTML markup of a web page can be written with any text editor, specialized HTML editors can offer convenience, speed, and additional features. For example, many HTML editors handle not only HTML, but also related technologies such as CSS, XML and JavaScript or ECMAScript. In some cases they also manage communication with remote web servers via FTP and WebDAV, and version control systems such as Subversion or Git.</p>
                    <h3>FTP program</h3>
                    <p>

                        The command line is used to type commands and launch programs. Some programs can only be launched from the command line, while others have a graphical user interface that can be used instead.
