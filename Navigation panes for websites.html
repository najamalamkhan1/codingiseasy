            <h3>Navigation on a web site</h3>
            <p>Accessibility to other pertinent pages on the website is vital, much as the website's content. The
                website should be simple to use in terms of navigation. This includes the location, which is illustrated
                on the page about generic design principles. The navigation pane's design is another element.

                There are two primary categories of navigation panes:
                Orienting navigation windows to indicate your location on the website

                Links leading to other website pages
                Most people think of a navigation pane as a link to other pages on a website. Similar to the one on this
                page's headline, They come in a variety of sizes and positions, and they are essential for websites that
                have a number of pages. Further information on those is provided below.

                On large and complicated websites, like news websites, the orienting navigation windows typically appear
                in a single line at the top of the page.</p>

            <!-- navigation -->
            <h4><b>Name of the news site > Domestic > Politics > Local politics</b></h4>
            <p>for articles about local politics, whereas articles about soccer could look something like this:</p>

            <h4>Name of the news site > Sports > Soccer</h4>
            <p>Most sites aren't sufficiently big and complex to justify this type of navigation panes, but they do
                exist.</p>
            <!-- navigation -->

            <h3>MouseOver/Hover effects</h3>
            <p>When moving the cursor over the elements in the navigation pane, it is advisable to have a feed back in
                the form of something changing. It can be changes in colors, as seen on the example to the right,
                animations, changes in font size or something entirely different. The effect being used has no influence
                on the functionality of the link, so in principle, it is not a requirement to have something indicating
                that here you have something to click on. It is a purely psychological effect. Something is happening
                where you are holding the cursor, so there is something to click on.
