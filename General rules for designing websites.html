            <h3>When you are Starting?</h3>
            <p>A web site's design and content are frequently not completely evident when it is first launched, and even
                when they are, you must be ready to make multiple revisions until you are satisfied. A web page's design
                is a creative process in and of itself that should ideally be unrestricted by restrictions to allow for
                the realisation of good ideas. If you want to create a website that appeals to people outside of your
                personal family and friends, there are a few basic guidelines to keep in mind.</p>
            <h3>Content is king</h3>
            <p>Visitors to websites typically do so for one of two reasons: informational purposes or amusement-related
                purposes. People won't bother to visit your website if this is missing. As the saying goes, content is
                king. You could get away with creating a site with no genuine content in the early years of the World
                Wide Web, approximately 1996â€“1997, when people were just intrigued about the new mass medium. People
                would visit a site if it existed because there weren't many options available. That's not the situation
                anymore. A website that we have previously seen offers more than 900 million options right now. Content,
                content, and content are your site's three most crucial components.</p>
            <h3>Take a programming course</h3>
            <p>It's a popular misconception that you don't need to know how to programme if you use existing platforms
                like Joomla and others. If you can get by with utilising a template, you can avoid doing much
                programming and create the impression that the design will be simple. However, how awesome is it to have
                a website that resembles countless other pages?
                <br />
                <br />
                Anytime you plan to perform something that resembles design, you'll need to have a rudimentary
                understanding of programming. The benefit of learning to programme is that it is simple to get started
                and put something together that appears to be well-put-together.
            </p>
            <h3>Name of files</h3>
            <p>File names and folders can reportedly contain spaces and uncommon characters, such as the Danish letters
                ae,, and. You can, but it would be a terrible idea. Some search engines can't handle spaces and other
                special characters, and those that can sometimes get stuck and only index a portion of the link. It
                deters users from the site and generates numerous pointless error warnings. Use the numerals, the upper-
                and lower-case letters a through z, as well as the two dashes.</p>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>It's always a good idea to set up the pages so that visitors can find the other worthwhile elements of
                the site once you've created information that someone could be interested in.

                The visitor's eyes are drawn to the top of the page and a portion of the left margin, according to eye
                tracking experiments. Approximately 5 centimetres from the top of the page, not all the way up to the
                top edge. The left margin is similar. Not right up to the edge, but a few centimetres inside.
                essentially the same way we read words on a piece of paper. You have the reader's full focus in these
                sections, so here
                To make it easier for the reader to navigate the website, you include navigation panes and headlines.
                It's not a joke, folks. Because they are so focused on creating content, many website owners and
                designers neglect to create a functional navigation system for their website. As a result, users are
                unaware that you have additional information available.

                Various methods of navigation exist, based on requirements and tastes. The general rule is that it must
                be clear and simple to comprehend. Ask someone to check out the website if you are unsure. It's fine if
                they can navigate without any issues or guidance; if not, the navigation has to be improved.
